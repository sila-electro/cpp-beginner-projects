# C++ Beginner Projects

Hi! This repository contains small beginner-friendly C++ projects I'm building while following the Codecademy C++ course.

My goal is to become a professional in Embedded Systems.  
Each project in this repo reflects one key concept from the C++ basics.

Completed so far:
- Hello World âœ…  
- Variables âœ…  
- Conditionals and Logic âœ…  
- Loops (in progress) ðŸš§

More projects coming soon! ðŸš€
