# Beginner C++ Projects

This repository contains beginner-friendly C++ programs to practice basic concepts like input/output, variables, conditionals, loops, and functions. These projects are part of a 2-month embedded systems and programming self-study roadmap.

## Projects
- Hello World
- Basic Variable Operations
- Conditional Logic (Age & Name)
- Basic Calculator
- Number Guessing Game

More projects will be added as I progress.

🌱 Follow my journey!

##functions_calculator.cpp
A simple calculator program using C++ functions. It includes basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, and multiplication using separate functions for each.

## Min and Max Finder

This program asks the user to input three integers, then calculates the maximum and minimum values using two custom functions: `findMax()` and `findMin()`.  
This helped reinforce the use of functions in C++.

### 📘 Grade Calculator

This program takes three exam grades from the user, calculates the weighted average, and displays the corresponding letter grade based on standard grading rules.
It was created to practice functions and conditionals in C++.

 Project: Average of Three Numbers
Description:
This program takes three numbers from the user and calculates their average using a separate function. It demonstrates how to use functions, parameters, and return values in C++.

Key Concepts Used:

Functions with parameters and return type

User input (cin)

Output to console (cout)

Basic arithmetic
