# Beginner C++ Projects

This repository contains beginner-friendly C++ programs to practice basic concepts like input/output, variables, conditionals, loops, and functions. These projects are part of a 2-month embedded systems and programming self-study roadmap.

## Projects
- Hello World
- Basic Variable Operations
- Conditional Logic (Age & Name)
- Basic Calculator
- Number Guessing Game

More projects will be added as I progress.

🌱 Follow my journey!

## 📅 Daily Progress 

- ✅ Completed Codecademy modules on **Loops** and **Vectors**.
- ✅ Started the **Functions** section with hands-on practice in Dev C++.
- ✅ Watched 8 videos from the [“C++ Full Course” YouTube playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUYQLIy5z5qFhtre18J7hK_d0N7kbhn8g).
- ✅ Uploaded all projects to GitHub with clean structure.
- ⚠️ Skipped Chinese study today; to be resumed tomorrow.
- 🧠 Learned how to upload code files, write README.md, and organize repos for portfolio use.

##functions_calculator.cpp
A simple calculator program using C++ functions. It includes basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, and multiplication using separate functions for each.

## Min and Max Finder

This program asks the user to input three integers, then calculates the maximum and minimum values using two custom functions: `findMax()` and `findMin()`.  
This helped reinforce the use of functions in C++.

### 📘 Grade Calculator

This program takes three exam grades from the user, calculates the weighted average, and displays the corresponding letter grade based on standard grading rules.
It was created to practice functions and conditionals in C++.

 Project: Average of Three Numbers
Description:
This program takes three numbers from the user and calculates their average using a separate function. It demonstrates how to use functions, parameters, and return values in C++.

Key Concepts Used:

Functions with parameters and return type

User input (cin)

Output to console (cout)

Basic arithmetic

Project: Count Positive Numbers
Concepts Practiced: for loop, if statement, user input, basic logic

💡 What I learned:
In this small project, I practiced combining loops and conditionals in C++. I asked the user to input 5 numbers and then counted how many of them were positive.

It helped me understand:

How to use a loop to repeat code multiple times

How to take user input and check conditions using if

How to use a counter variable to track results

🧠 My reflection:
This exercise was helpful because I could see how loops and conditionals work together. I’m getting more comfortable with writing logic in C++. Even though I still need more practice to write code on my own without help, I understand the structure much better now.

I also started to learning python.

#1 MONTH İMPROVİNG CHALLENGE <3

I watched tutorials and now I'm starting doing more and more practice with c++.
